      Washington, officially the State of Washington and often referred to as
      Washington state to distinguish it from the national capital, Washington,
      D.C., is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the Western United
      States. Named for George Washington—the first U.S. president—the state was
      formed from the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded
      by the British Empire in 1846, by the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of
      the Oregon boundary dispute. The state is bordered on the west by the
      Pacific Ocean, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian
      province of British Columbia to the north. It was admitted to the Union as
      the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital; the state's largest
      city is Seattle.
